## Inspired by [IREnFIST](https://modworkshop.net/mod/28585)



### Purpose of this mod:
* Make all weapons equally viable on DW difficulty
* Provide new skills to increase build variety
* Decrease reliance on damage increasing skills/OP weapons

##### This mod is not trying to achieve realism by basing weapon stats off of weapon caliber/real life performance. It's not trying to make every weapon deal same DPS as an RPG. The only thing this mod is trying to do, is provide an alternative gameplay experience for any PD2 player, no matter if you are a veteran or a newbie to the game.



-----



##### Description bellow will note __every single change__ made by this mod, including reasons/ideas for most of the changes, whether it's a new skill or weapon damage values.

It's **VERY** long, and that's how it is supposed to be. It's unrealistic for you to remember all the changes and purposes behind them, so having this 'guide' will be useful, if you want to experiment with some new weapon/skill combos. 

Going through all changes might not be a good idea if you are here for the first time, since reading about new weapon stats is not the same as actually playing with them in game (also, i cant fit ALL the stat changes here). So, for first time readers i've created this small guide bellow.

[color=#5ec4d4][size=large]**For players who are here for the first time:**[/color][/size]

||
If you never tried Gilza before, i would recommend learning about it's changes in this order:

1) General changes
2) Melee rework (located almost at the bottom of weapon changes)
3) All Perk and Skill changes (or at the very least those that are marked with a blue [color=#5ec4d4] * [/color] )
4) Weapon changes - general
5) Weapon changes - stability rework and weapon performance
6) Shotguns weapon tab (To see how most weapon reworks are handled. Includes shotgun ammo changes.)

After that, make a mental note that this mod __DECREASES__ your overall time to kill with most weapons, but it also __DECREASES__ overall ammo pick up.

After processing all of that, you can probably figure out if you like this rebalance.
And if you do, download it and give it a go.
The 'feel' of how weapons perform in Gilza can not be transcribed directly. It all really comes down to the fact if you like this feel or not, which can only be determined in game.

[FrenchyAU](https://modworkshop.net/user/25971)'s tacticool weapon mod packs are __highly__ recommended to use along side Gilza, to increase your weapon build variety. Links to recommended packs are under Weapon Attachments at the bottom of the page.

However, before installing Gilza don't forget to install:
* [BeardLib](https://modworkshop.net/mod/14924)
* [WeaponLib](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24177)
* [The Fixes](https://modworkshop.net/mod/23732) - this mod is required due to how wanky PD2 is sometimes with custom skills, especially if you will try to remove GIlza before resetting your skill trees
* [AFSF](https://modworkshop.net/mod/20403) - fixes how weapon sounds are played in full auto. It's not necessary, but some weapons in Gilza had their rate of fire changed, which could lead to full-auto fire sounds mismatching weapon's firing speed
* [More Weapon Stats](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/more_weapon_stats.html) is also recommended if you are a stat nerd, and want to see all weapon stats in game by yourself
||



-----



Use [Fixes](https://modworkshop.net/mod/23732) to prevent crashes after installing or (most likely) removing this mod.
Additionally, because of the way DMR kits were reworked [color=#ff3333]they might freeze your game[/color], if you try to modify weapons that had DMR kits installed before installing Gilza. Selling those weapons fixes this issue. You can buy and modify new guns safely after that. Affected weapons: Car-4 AR, Amr16 AR, Ak AR, Ak762 AR, Ks12 AR, Gewehr 3 AR, Broomstick pistol, Akron HC LMG.


-----



:::### General changes:::
||
* All enemies (above and including overkill difficulty) had their health increased by 30%
* All enemies now have a headshot multiplier of 3, except for cloakers and dozers (their multipliers are different for every difficulty, should feel close to vanilla PD2)
* Vehicle FOV was changed from base 75 to 90 (you can change it in mod options in game)||

:::### Perk deck changes:::
||
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] [color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]Common perk deck cards:[/color][/size]

[color=#e4df86]**Common 2nd card**:[/color] getting a random headshot multiplier from perk decks is weird, and makes it painful to balance this mod, so skill from card#8 was moved here
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk%20card%202.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Common 6th card**:[/color] now you can pick up normal grenades from ammo boxes without investing into fully loaded skill. This should make players running non-injector perks have even more variety in their weapon choices. To compensate, grenade amounts were reduced. See throwable weapon changes for more info.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk_card_6%20-%201.8.2.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Common 8th card**:[/color] random 5% damage increase. Why? Now you receive more movement speed from basic parkour and bag throwing bonus from basic transporter. Transporter and parkour skills were reworked accordingly
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk%20card%208.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Perk deck changes:[/color][/size]

[color=#e4df86]**Sociopath/Infiltrator 1st card**:[/color] was changed due to melee rework. Also the hidden infiltrator duration buff was removed, so both decks now have a 4 second window for additional hits
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Overdog_1.7.2.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Sicario**:[/color] Smoke bomb cooldown was reduced from 60 to 40 seconds.

[color=#e4df86]**Gambler 1st card**:[/color] Gambler overall is a niche deck that can rarely work well, and it's health regen feels really inconsistent, especially since your teammates may run builds with berserker and always be on low health. Now, as far as you have at least 1 teammate with more health then you, you will receive higher and more consistent healing, but your max possible burst healing is reduced.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Gambler_1_1.8.1.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Rogue 9th card**:[/color] Ever since the introduction of COPYCAT perk deck, rogue became obsolete. If we assume that ricochet and weapon swap+auto reload from copycat are on par with rouge's AP chance and weapon swap speed, it's safe to say that you practically sacrifice 5% overall dodge chance to get health regen and health invulnerability when using copycat instead of rogue. To balance this out, rogue will now have 5% extra dodge (so 10% more then copycat), 5% extra dodge while crouched, extra mobility and more consistent AP chance. These changes, if pared with certain skills, will provide a really fun run and gun gameplay experience.

:::### New Brawler Perk deck:::
|| 
A new melee focused perk with great damage resistances but extremely limited firearm usage.

[color=#e4df86]**Brawler 1st card**:[/color]
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/brawler1_1.5.3.jpg)

:::### Skill changes:::

__If a certain tree is not mentioned here, that means that it received no changes.__

#### Mastermind
|| 
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Sharpshooter sub-tree:[/color][/size]

[color=#e4df86]**Stable shot**:[/color] This skill now only gives accuracy bonuses
I actually wanted to make it 3 for base and 9 for aced, but game would crash because values are not divisible by 4 :(
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/stable%20shot.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Rifleman**:[/color] Aced version of this skill is now focused on using your weapons while moving and aiming. Info on Gilza's weapon inaccuracy can be found under weapon's performance tab.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/rifleman_1.8.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Marksman**:[/color] buffs LMG's if you use them with bipods. LMG's received nerfs to accuracy, stability and ammo economy, so this should provide useful alternative defensive playstyle for them, considering Gilza's improved bipod accuracy.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/marksman.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Aggressive reload**:[/color] Considering that speed pull mags increase your reload speed by cutting it in half, having a skill that gives you 15% reload speed (even though quite cheaply) seems laughable, so the increase is now slightly higher
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Aggresive_reload_1.8.1.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Graze**:[/color] amount of damage that is dealt in the radius is no longer affected by current HP of the target that was hit - now always deals 33%/66% of your sniper's damage in the radius on both bodyshots and headshots. This damage can only be increased with other damage related skills. This change should provide a more consistent experience while using graze, while also reducing it's max effective damage. Minimal trigger distance for graze was also added to incentivize actual sniping, instead of holding corridors on 'No Mercy'
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/graze_1.8.4.jpg)
||

#### Enforcer
|| 
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Shotgunner sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]Shotguns have been reworked significantly, and are now much more effective with no skills. New skills bellow should provide better bonuses considering reworked stats.

[color=#e4df86]**Shotgun CQB**:[/color] ADS bonus was moved to shotgun impact (renamed to shotgun expert)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/shotgunCQB.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Shotgun impact**:[/color] extra damage is no longer needed, get some extra stability and ads speed instead
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/shotgun%20impact.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Far away**:[/color] magazine increasing skill from Close By aced was reworked into this one, to let any shotgun get benefits from it, but the bonus itself is overall lower.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/far%20away.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Close by**:[/color] just a slight ROF nerf, because shotguns are more powerful in general
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/close%20by.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Overkill**:[/color] is not required anymore to use shotguns well, but it will still give you good bonuses if you run it with semi-auto or full auto shotguns with new breakpoints. Also works even better if aced now, since most other weapons have more consistent damage output
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/overkil.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Tank  sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Transporter**:[/color] because you get throwing power bonus in the perk deck cards, it would make sense for this skill to be buffed. Aced version is really fun, but requires a hefty investment.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/tranporter.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Ammo Specialist  sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Saw massacre**:[/color] Gilza introduces breaching rounds for shotguns that can make saw feel obsolete. But due to it's increased damage and consistent ammo consumption, it will feel much better with up-close builds then a breaching round shotgun. This skill will now provide ammo pick up for the saw, making it an actually viable weapon. Pick up is not affected by fully loaded or walk-in-closet perk deck bonuses.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Saw_massacre_1.8.1.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Fully loaded**:[/color] just a buff since now one ever uses this skill. You can now have much more nades throughout the game, but max amount of nades was reduced so you can't spam them all at once as effectively. See throwable weapon changes for more info.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/fullyloaded.jpg)

#### Technician
||
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Oppressor sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86]**Steady grip**:[/color] this is now a pure stability skill
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/steady%20grip.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Fire control**:[/color] aced version now removes Gilza's weapon inaccuracy, more info on that can be found under weapon's performance tab
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/fire%20control_1.8.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Body expertise**:[/color] this perk is a bit too strong considering increased TTK of Gilza, now gives a bit more fair values, that are still really powerful
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Gilza_BE.jpg)
||

#### Ghost
||
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Artful dodger sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86]**Parkour**:[/color] movement bonus is now part of perk decks so other upgrades from this skill were moved around a bit
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/parlour.jpg)
||

#### Fugitive
||
[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Gunslinger sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Gun nut:**[/color] all full-auto pistols got a 25% increase to their normal ROF, while semi-auto pistols got a 50% ROF decrease. This skill was adjusted accordingly. Now semi-auto pistols actually feel different with this skill, while full-auto pistols still have same max ROF as they did in vanilla (if you had a full-auto pistol with 900 ROF after applying gun nut in vanilla PD2, it will still be 900 with this skill in Gilza). Considering all of that, it would feel a bit too pricey to buy extra 20% performance for 4 skill points, so bonuses were swapped and mag increase was buffed to be a bit more appealing.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/gun%20nut%20-%201.7.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**One handed talent:**[/color] all pistol now deal much more damage per bullet, and increasing their damage from 140 to 155 is pointless. It also would benefit all pistols differently due to their damage variety, so it was replaced with a new ammunition skill that is useful for any pistol.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/OHT%20-%20bottomless.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Revenant sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Up you go**:[/color] this skill never made sense to me. Getting 4% of you total max health for 4 aced points on Mayhem and above is pointless. Now gives you health amounts instead of a %.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/UYG.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] Brawler sub-tree:[/color][/size]
[color=#e4df86]**Bloodthirst**:[/color] Re-balanced according to new melee damage mechanics. Max stacks should guarantee insta-kill on any non-bulldozer enemy with lowest damaging melees (~15 damage)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/bloodthirst.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Pumping iron**:[/color] now provides more melee weapon flexibility and quicker charge times to make melee weapons feel better
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/pumpiron.jpg)

[color=#e4df86][color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Berserker**:[/color] In theory - cool risk-reward perk. In practise - armorer/anarchist's best friend with no downsides (ok, maybe rare snipers, but that's it). Now provides an active temporary effect triggered on armor break while under half health. This change should provide a more engaging experience while reducing overall effectiveness of this skill. Note that since you are no longer required to be at super low health to receive damage increase, you can now actually run healing skills for decks like anarchist or armorer, to not get one-tapped by snipers. This rework also provides a flash effect on screen to indicate damage increase duration.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/berserk_1.8.4.jpg)
This flash can be customized (flash type, color, trigger conidition) or disabled in Gilza's mod options. How it looks:

-----

:::### Weapon changes:::

#### General:
||
* All DMR kits were reworked into 'Armor Piercing Kits' that can penetrate body armor, shields and walls. Due to technical limitations, they are now categorized as ammunition
* Most mag increasing mods now make your reload speed slower
* Normal grenades should not explode mid air if hit by bullets (Host only)
||

#### Stability rework and weapon performance:
||

[color=#ca8f2f]**Affected weapon categories: all**[/color]
* You now suffer from 25% accuracy penalty when shooting while moving (both ADS and hip-fire)



-----



[color=#ca8f2f]**Affected weapon categories: Assault rifles, SMG's(+akimbo) and LMG's**[/color]
* You can now suffer from 30% accuracy penalty if your weapon is toggled to full-auto fire mode. If you switch to single-fire fire mode during the heist your accuracy will be increased (provides some usage to the switch fire mod keybind, and also makes you feel tacticool)
* You receive 50% bonus to stability if your weapon is toggled to single-fire mode


-----


[color=#ca8f2f]**Affected weapon categories: AR's, SMG's(+akimbo),LMG's, Full-auto Pistols(+akimbo), Miniguns(including Hailstorm)**[/color]
* Your base stability value now represents how much visual recoil your weapon will have by default. This amount can be decreased with weapon modifications as usual
* Amount of horizontal recoil was overall reduced
* Horizontal recoil will now also be dependent on base stability. If base stability value starts with number divisible by 2, recoil will lean mostly to the left, and vise versa. (Example: 24 base stability will favour weapon recoil to the left, and 56 will favour it to the right)

[color=#e4df86]**What does this all mean?**[/color]

Base stability value is now going to be more important then amount of stability bonuses you can give to weapons. If some weapon has base stability of <10 its going to be really hard to control even if you get it to 100 stability with mods/skills. However the opposite is also true, where weapons with high base stability will feel like laser beams, and you won't have to worry about getting any stability bonuses for them. 

Horizontal recoil is overall easier to predict.
You will now have to toggle your weapon's fire mode (if it can do that) based on the engagement distance.

Some weapons might feel the same, and others completely different from vanilla. 
And yes, max recoil you can have here is higher then in vanilla (try Amr-16 with no mods for lolz).
||

[color=#5ec4d4][size=large]**All showcases of damage profiles are based on DW difficulty health values.**[/color][/size]
#### Assault rifles:
||
New breakpoints introduced, overall TTK was reduced.
All DMR kits were reworked into Armour piercing kits that can penetrate shields, body armor and walls, but ammo pick up while using them is halfed. 
M308 and galant rifles received AP rounds, that are similar to ap kits, but have better ammo economy.
All AR's use new stability rework.
7.62 little friend AR can be equipped with a 5.56 conversion kit that reduces damage but increases ammo pick up
Car-4 AR can use HP rounds to change it's damage profile from 177 to 210

| Damage profile | Shots to kill normal swat in the head | Shots to kill heavy swat in the head | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 117 dmg     | 2     | 4    | Best for crits |
| 146 dmg | 2 | 3 | If used with overkill aced, and base damage is increased with mods to 149+ becomes 1-2 bullets to kill type, great for ammo economy. |
| 177 dmg | 2 | 3 | Basically 146 profile, but with better anti-dozer potential at a cost of total ammo pick up.|
| 210 dmg     | 1     | 2    | Most average, most stable, poor ammo economy if not accurate.|
| 420 dmg | 1 | 1 | Usually highest recoil and worst ammo economy. Best combined with body expertise/ammo related skills.|


||

#### Shotguns:
||
This one is most interesting in my opinion.
Damage profile depends on shotgun type:


| Shotgun type | Damage profile | Shots to kill normal swat in the head | Shots to kill heavy swat in the head |  Specialization |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pump-action    | 420 dmg     | 1    | 1    | Most accurate but slowest. Recommended ammo: slug, to pen shields or HE |
| Semi-auto no mag    | 305 dmg | 1 | 2 | The in-betweeners. Become 1-1 bullets to kill type with overkill. Recommended ammo: flechette or tombstone slugs, to not waste as much ammo finishing off low hp targets|
| Semi or full-auto with mag    | 110 dmg     | 2     | 4    |Spammm. Recommended ammo: buckshot for better breakpoints with overkill, HE or Dragon's Breath |
| Double barrel   | 1250 dmg | 1 | 1 |Can one-shot-bodyshot normal and heavy swats. One-shot everyone else in the head. Recommended ammo: flechette or slugs. |

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] One new ammo type was added for __primary__ pump-action shotguns:[/color][/size]

[color=#e4df86]**Breaching round**:[/color] Can open any locked space that OVE9000 saw usually can. Allows to pen shields, walls and body armor. Damage and damage over range are cut significantly.

[color=#ca8f2f][size=x-large] All shotgun ammo types were reworked:[/color][/size]

[color=#e4df86]**Buckshot**:[/color] now increases damage based on the shotgun category, so all shotguns gain roughly the same breakpoint bonuses. Ammo pick up reduced by 20%

Benefits for every shotgun type:
- Pump action: can one-shot tazer/marshal marksmen/medics/cloakers with a headshot
- Semi-auto no mag: can one-shot tazer/marshal marksmen/medics/cloakers with a headshot if paired with overkill skill
- Semi/Full-auto with mag: will become 1-2 (normal-heavy swats) shots to kill if paired with overkill skill
- Double-barrel: can one-shot tazer/marshal marksmen/medics with a bodyshot

[color=#e4df86]**HE Slug**:[/color] doubles your damage (but no headshot extra damage). Removes all stability, cuts ammo pick up by 60% and total capacity by 50%

[color=#e4df86]**Flechette**:[/color] no longer gives any stat changes. 'Pellet' amount reduced to 5. Gain body armor piercing and slightly better drop off damage as usual.

[color=#e4df86]**AP slugs**:[/color] removed accuracy and damage stats, cuts total ammo capacity ~40% and ammo pick up by 25%

[color=#e4df86]**Dragon's breath**:[/color] cuts total ammo by 50%, ammo pick up by 80%. Reduces accuracy and amount of pellets from 12 to 6. No extra headshot damage. Distance at which fire can be triggered was reduced from 1400 to 900. Will deal 1180 damage over a 3 second period to any lit target. (Yes, it one-shots all swat's with any shotgun. Higher damaging shotguns can 'one shot' some specials.)

[color=#e4df86]**Tombstone slug**:[/color] cuts total ammo by ~35%, and ammo pick up by 20%. Deals roughly 400 damage over 2 seconds. This will allow for all shotguns to benefit from this slug differently, depending on their breakpoints. Best shotgun shell for regen-based perks.

Benefits for every shotgun type if you include poison dmage:
- Pump action: can 'one-shot' tazer/marshal marksmen/medics after a headshot
- Semi-auto no mag: can 'one-shot' heavy swats after a headshot
- Semi/Full-auto with mag: can 'one-shot' normal swat after a headshot
- Double-barrel: can 'one-shot' tazer/marshal marksmen/medics after a bodyshot

||

#### Light machine guns:
||
Damage breakpoints are the same. Now use new stability rework. Ammo pick up reduced. Accuracy without a bipod is extremely poor, but you get extra 20% accuracy when bipoded compared to vanilla. Should provide a more defending playstyle if used with new "Slow and Steady" skill.
||

#### Sniper rifles:
||
All snipers were reworked to one-shot headshot any enemy (except dozers).
Balanced around BODYSHOTS now, and how many bullets it takes to kill enemies in the body.
Damage profile depends on sniper type:

| Sniper type | Damage profile | Shots to kill normal swat in the body | Shots to kill heavy swat in the body |  Specialization |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Semi-auto    | 560 dmg     | 2   | 3    | The basic one, only headshots 1 shot  |
| Lever-action   | 630 dmg | 1 | 2 | The anti-trash (enemy type i mean) one. Secondary bolt sniper also uses this dmg profile|
| Heavy bolt action    | 1260 dmg     | 1     | 1    |Kill normal and heavy swats with one shot to the body. Pretty good, ay? |
| The 50cal  | 8050 dmg | 1 | 1 |Can one-shot-bodyshot anyone. Dozers on DW difficulty take 2 bodyshots to kill, minigun dozers take 4. Double bullet amount for DS difficulty |

All sniper rifles have __identical ammo pick up.__(except for 50cal) Explanation: semi-auto snipers on average are much better when dealing with multiple enemies in a short period of time, thanks to their mag capacity and ROF. Bolt and lever action rifles are worse in this scenario, but due to their bodyshot damage, you don't have to aim for the head all the time, which means your accuracy on average will be higher with them. To summarize: if you are a good shot, semi-auto's will be best weapons of choice, due to their firepower, but if you feel like being lazy, or are not that good of a shot, you can sacrifice DPS to have overall better ammo economy due to less misses.

||

#### All akimbos:
||
Pretty much just copies of their non-akimbo counterparts, with less stability but slightly better ammo pickup. Akimbo SMG's and full auto pistols use new stability rework.
||

#### Specials:
||
Woohoo, the cool ones.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Bows/crossbows:**[/color][/size]
For the most part are balanced around bodyshots like snipers. Explosive shots now deal 2x the damage (since they cant get headshots that deal 3x damage). Heavy bows can one-shot-bodyshot tazers, light bows only normal swats, with one shot headshots on heavy swat.
Projectiles and their damage is handled by the host, so changes here will only be active when you are the host.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Saws:**[/color][/size]
Saws now show you their actual ammo, allow for reloads at any time and are more effective against enemies (all enemies receive 9x damage in-game compared to saw's stat when viewed in the inventory). Can now also pick up ammo with Saw Massacre (ACED) skill.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Flamethrowers:**[/color][/size]
Basically better now. Ammo capacity was nerfed, reload was slightly buffed, and damage was buffed by a lot. Magazines now completely change how flamethrower performs:



| Mag | Stats | Playstyle |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Rare    | leaves you with only 1 damage, but makes afterburn happen more often. Strongest afterburn damage over longest period of time     | Poke enemies to get them to burn, delaying them and letting them burn out while you are in cover   |
| Well done     | Doubles your damage but decreases chances for afterburn. Afterburn also deals really low damage     | Be more direct with your flames and don't rely on afterburn at all    |
| Default    | Only 25% chance for afterburn (75% base game) but afterburn will deal roughly 60% of hp to a normal swat     | All around  an ok choice   |

Secondary flamethrower has less damage and less ammo capacity.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Miniguns:**[/color][/size]
Damage breakpoints are identical. 
Ammo stats changed from 750/750 to 600/900
Reload sped up by 20%
Ammo pick up reduced, and is now different in between both miniguns since one does more damage per bullet then another.

Hailstorm now has 210/630 ammo and better accuracy/stability stats. Ammo pick up for it is slightly better then in vanilla as well.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Rocket launchers:**[/color][/size]
Damage breakpoints on dozers are the same. Radius was reduced by 25%. Both changes are host-sided.

[size=large][color=#e4df86]**Grenade launchers:**[/color][/size]

Almost all changes here are host-sided. That means that if you are a client and use grenade launchers you won't benefit from damage, blast radius  or velocity changes at all.

All grenade launchers had their blast radius nerfed by roughly 50% but damage increased by 300% to make launchers be less effective against big groups, but more effective against any enemy type.

Overall ammo pick up for all launchers is 20% lower then vanilla PD2.

[color=#c99ad5]Normal grenades:[/color]
Max damage was increased by almost 3 times, but the radius was nerfed to half of vanilla PD2. New "high velocity" grenades were added to gl40, piglet, compact 40mm and china lake. Comparison of normal grenade types:
|  | Vanilla PD2 | Gilza | Gilza High Velocity |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Damage    |   1000   |  4000 (enemies have more health so it's 3x the dmg) |  4000 |
| Radius     |   350   |  175   | 90 |
| Velocity     |    1.25  |   1.25  | 3.5 (arbiter in vanilla PD2 is 7) |

[color=#42ad14]Poison grenades[/color] were nerfed: they now can't really kill anything, at best they will get normal swat to 50% hp, BUT the damage over time effect is now 30 seconds, so keeping your grinder/anarchist regen is even easier. Don't expect to get any kills though. Recommended usage: snipe groups that are far away, so by the time they get to you they have less health.

[color=#ff3333]Incendiary grenades:[/color] most powerful area denial. Best time to kill. As a con, ammo pick up is almost non-existent.

[color=#14a1ad]Electric nades:[/color] no change.

Also, almost all launchers got reload speed buffs. Especially the piglet.
Launchers that have lower damage then others: Arbiter, Basilisk 3v.
||

#### Pistols:
||
Higher damage breakpoints introduced. 
Base ROF for all full-auto pistols was buffed by 25%. (max ROF with gun nut skill totals to be the same as without Gilza)
Base ROF for all semi-auto pistols was nerfed by ~50%
All pistols with AP bullets like 5/7, have reduced ammo pick ups.
Broomstick and Matever .357 revolver can now use AP kit/AP rounds to pen shields, walls and body armor.

| Damage profile | Shots to kill normal swat in the head | Shots to kill heavy swat in the head | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 77 dmg     | 3     | 6    | Some full auto pistols |
| 95 dmg     | 3     | 5    | Most full auto pistols |
| 117 dmg     | 2     | 4    | The low dmg ones |
| 146 dmg | 2 | 3 | The average ones, can be combined with overkill skill if damage raised to 149 with mods for improved breakpoints |
| 210 dmg     | 1     | 2    | Deagle and alike |
| 420 dmg | 1 | 1 | Mostly revolvers |
| 630 dmg | 1 | 1 | Can one-shot body shot normal swat. Used by Peacemaker and Kahn .357 (with a 6 round mag mod) revolvers |

||

#### Sub machine guns:
||
New breakpoints introduced, and overall ttk was reduced. Kobus90 (better known as p90) can also use AP rounds. All SMG's use new stability rework. 


| Damage profile | Shots to kill normal swat in the head | Shots to kill heavy swat in the head | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 95 dmg     | 3     | 5    | Most concealed with high ROF |
| 117 dmg | 2 | 4 | Kinda average |
| 146 dmg | 2 | 3 | If used with overkill aced, and base damage is increased with mods to 149+ become 1-2 bullets to kill type - great for ammo economy |
| 210 dmg     | 1     | 2    | CR805 and similar heavy ones |

||

#### Throwables:
||
Most changes here are host-sided. That means that if you are a client you won't benefit from damage or blast radius changes at all.
For the most part throwable grenades are twice as effective as their launcher counterparts. All other non-grenade throwables are now balanced around bodyshots. Most throwable weapon amounts were reduced(this change is not host-sided). Additional info and stats are included in throwable weapon's descriptions in game.

Also, all throwables like knives, cards or javelins can now pierce body armor of heavy swats.
||

#### Melee weapon overhaul:
||
##### Melee weapon damage that you see in your inventory now represent how much % of enemy's HP that weapon will deal with a swing. This includes charged damage as well. So if you have a melee weapon with 25(50) damage, it will kill any[color=#ff3333]* [/color]enemy in 4(2) hits.

Brawler skill tree was reworked respectively to these changes. Additionally grey swats can now be knocked down by melee weapons.

[color=#ff3333]* [/color]Some enemies will take less melee damage compared to normal cops:
* Bulldozers receive[color=#14a1ad] 3 [/color] times less melee damage, so melee with 35 damage will kill dozers in 9 hits
* All bosses receive[color=#14a1ad] 5 [/color] times less melee damage, so melee with 35 damage will kill bosses in 15 hits
* Winters and his shields receive[color=#14a1ad] 1.5 [/color] times less melee damage, so melee with 25 damage will kill Winters/W. shields in 6 hits


Almost all melee weapons were tweaked into categories in the table bellow.

Table legend:
Attack delay - delay before you damage the enemy after you let go of the melee button
Cooldown - delay in between melee attacks if you spam melee button

| Type | Damage  | Knockdown | Charge time |  Attack delay | Cooldown |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Weapon butt    | 25     | 100    | 0 | 0 | 0.6 | 
| Weak  | 20(35)     | 20(35)     | 1 | 0.1 | 0.3 |
| Average  | 25(50)    | 50(100)    | 1.5 | 0.1 | 0.6 |
| Average - knock   | 25(50)      | 750(1250)    | 2 | 0.1 | 0.7 |
| Heavy   | 35(75)     | 70(150)   | 3 | 0.2 | 0.9 |
| Heavy - knock   | 35(75)     | 1000(1750)   | 3.5 | 0.2 | 1 |
| Super heavy   | 50(100)     | 100(150)    | 4 | 0.5 | 1.2 |
| Super heavy - knock   |  50(100)    | 1300(2250)    | 4.5 | 0.5 | 1.4 |

Note that some weapons may have slight differences to their stats to sync better with their animations. Some notable changes:
* Psycho knife uses same stats as "weak" type, but has max damage of 150 with a charge time of 11 seconds. Just to have a reason to listen to that awesome charging sound :D

Also, to not cause confusion, almost all melee charge sounds were removed (due to charge time mis match). It's recommended to use some other (HUD) mod to visually show you your melee charge progress on your screen.
||

#### Weapon attachments:
||
Some weapon attachments had their stats changed, most of these changes are minor but there are a few things to note:
- Magazines that increase your bullet amount now slow down your reload speed
- All weapon sights now have no accuracy/stability stat changes, so you can choose any sight (inlucing iron sights) without thinking about minor stat tweaks that they provide, its all about preference now
- Secondary sights now have a bit more 'logical' stats
- Full-auto/single-fire mods now give higher stat changing values that benefit different weapons/weapon builds. Just keep Gilza's weapon fire mode alterations in mind when using them

Gilza also supports over 250+ weapon attachments made by [FrenchyAU](https://modworkshop.net/user/25971). Their stats were altered to be in line with Gilza's re-balance, stat variety for these mods was also increased. I highly recommend you use some (actually probably all) of FrenchyAU's tacticool packs. Here's links to most of them, listed in order of how much impact those packs will have on your weapon modding capabilities:
- [Tacticool magazines](https://modworkshop.net/mod/33331)
- [Tacticool muzzle devices](https://modworkshop.net/mod/31699)
- [Tacticool suppressors](https://modworkshop.net/mod/31250)
- [Tacticool foregrips](https://modworkshop.net/mod/32633)
- [Tacticool barrels](https://modworkshop.net/mod/36967)
- [Tacticool stocks](https://modworkshop.net/mod/31355)
- [Tacticool gadgets](https://modworkshop.net/mod/36416)

Other tacticool packs made by FrenchyAU are also supported.

:::### Custom Weapons Support:::

This mod will automatically search for custom weapons and convert their stats to work with Gilza's changes. Some custom weapons may have attachments that change damage/ammo pick up or other stats that most likey will not match Gilza's values. Individual support is requred for these mods.

Currently supported categories are color coded below:
- [color=#e4df86]**Automatic**[/color] - changes damage and ammo pick up for custom weapons, adds individual changes for categories like new recoil system for AR's and SMG's. This is not a perfect solutuion, but it will make any custom weapon viable with Gilza's numbers untill i get some time to tweak custom weapons individually. 
- [color=#11db02]**Individual**[/color] - adds individual support for weapon/attachment mods to match Gilza's rebalance.


Currently supported weapon categories:
[color=#e4df86]**Custom Assault Rifles**:[/color]
||
Damage is converted based on the weapon's damage value and will match it's performance in vanilla. Ammo pick up is reduced to Gilza's values. 
Recoil rework was added, which is based on base stability value of the gun.
Accuracy and stability will change depending on weapon's fire rate and total ammo capacity (so more ammo/rof - less accuracy/stability). Ratio of accuracy to stability is kept the same (so a gun with 60 acc and 52 stab will have 8 more acc then stab after Gilza's changes). Accuracy stat can not go higher then whatever this custom AR's accuracy was set to by the creator, but it can be lower. Stability can be both higher and lower then what it was set to.
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom SMG's**:[/color]
||
Same as AR's, smg's in primary slot get more ammo. (should work with akimbo's as well)
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom pistols**:[/color]
||
Damage/ammo pick up will match vanilla PD2 pistols. Rate of fire will change the same way (so full auto pistols have more ROF and semi-auto pistols less ROF). Full-auto pistols have new recoil. Pistols in primary slot get more ammo. (should work with akimbo's as well)
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom LMG's**:[/color]
||
Damage is converted based on the weapon's damage value and will match it's performance in vanilla. Ammo pick up is reduced to Gilza's values. 
Recoil rework was added, which is based on base stability value of the gun. Stability value will get increased if set too low by the weapon mod's creator.
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom Snipers**:[/color]
||
Changes damage,ammo pick up,sometimes rate of fire to match other snipers in GIlza. Unlike other categories however, this one needs individual tweaking the most, because weapon stats should be based on weapon type (like bolt-action/semi-auto). Right now it's based on damage, which is not ideal at all.
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom Shotguns**:[/color]
||
Changes damage, ammo pick up and stats for ammuntion (like buckshot/HE) based on the damage. Same as with snipers, requres more individual tweaking since it's impossible to identify weapon type based on weapon stats. Currently uses weapon damage as identification method, which is not ideal at all.
||
[color=#e4df86]**Custom Melee weapons**:[/color]
|| 
Converts damage based on weapon's melee attack delay/cooldown in-between swings. Has alterations to stats for weapons with poison/fire/electric damage.
||
[color=#11db02]**Individual support:**[/color]
|| 
This list will (hopefully) expand with every patch.

Currently supported attachment mods:
- All of [FrenchyAU](https://modworkshop.net/user/25971)'s tacticool attachments packs (250+ attachments)

Weapons that received individual tweaks for all of their stats and attachments:
**Snipers**
* [L115 by >:3](https://modworkshop.net/mod/17368)
* [Barrett M107CQ by >:3](https://modworkshop.net/mod/27195)

* [McMillan CS5 by >:3](https://modworkshop.net/mod/21267)
* [RSASS by youngrich99](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24702)
||

Custom special weapon support is not planned. Custom minigun support might be added later.

-----



Future of this mod:
Damage profiles will most likely never change, but weapon accuracy, stability, ammo pick up, etc. might be changed with future updates.
Also, some melee weapons may need a few more stat tweaks to avoid their animations being too slow/fast.

Enjoy figuring out new META and please provide feedback if something feels way too good. GLHF :D
