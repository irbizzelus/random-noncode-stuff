### Bows/crossbows:
For the most part are balanced around bodyshots like snipers. Explosive shots now deal 2x the damage (since they cant get headshots that deal 3x damage). Heavy bows can one-shot-bodyshot tazers, light bows only normal swats, with one shot headshots on heavy swat.
Projectiles and their damage is handled by the host, so changes here will only be active when you are the host.

### Saws:
Saws now show you their actual ammo, allow for reloads at any time and are more effective against enemies (all enemies receive 9x damage in-game compared to saw's stat when viewed in the inventory). Can now also pick up ammo with Saw Massacre (ACED) skill.

### Flamethrowers:
Basically better now. Ammo capacity was nerfed, reload was slightly buffed, and damage was buffed by a lot. Magazines now completely change how flamethrower performs:
|Mag|Stats|Playstyle|
|--------|--------|--------|
|Rare|leaves you with only 1 damage, but makes afterburn happen more often. Strongest afterburn damage over longest period of time|Poke enemies to get them to burn, delaying them and letting them burn out while you are in cover|
|Well done|Doubles your damage but decreases chances for afterburn. Afterburn also deals really low damage|Be more direct with your flames and don't rely on afterburn at all|
|Default|Only 25% chance for afterburn (75% base game) but afterburn will deal roughly 60% of hp to a normal swat|All around an ok choice|

Secondary flamethrower has less damage and less ammo capacity.

### Miniguns:
Damage breakpoints are identical. 
Ammo stats changed from 750/750 to 600/900
Reload sped up by 20%
Ammo pick up reduced, and is now different in between both miniguns since one does more damage per bullet then another.

Hailstorm now has 210/630 ammo and better accuracy/stability stats. Ammo pick up for it is slightly better then in vanilla as well.

### Rocket launchers:
Damage breakpoints on dozers are the same. Radius was reduced by 25%. Both changes are host-sided.

### Grenade launchers:

Almost all changes here are host-sided. That means that if you are a client and use grenade launchers you won't benefit from damage, blast radius  or velocity changes at all.

All grenade launchers had their blast radius nerfed by roughly 50% but damage increased by 300% to make launchers be less effective against big groups, but more effective against any enemy type.

Overall ammo pick up for all launchers is 20% lower then vanilla PD2.

**Normal grenades:**
Max damage was increased by almost 3 times, but the radius was nerfed to half of vanilla PD2. New "high velocity" grenades were added to gl40, piglet, compact 40mm and china lake. Comparison of normal grenade types:
||Vanilla PD2|Gilza|Gilza High Velocity|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|Damage|1000|4000 (enemies have more health so it's 3x the dmg)|4000|
|Radius|350|175|90|
|Velocity|1.25|1.25|3.5 (arbiter in vanilla PD2 is 7)|

**Poison grenades:** nerfed. They now can't really kill anything, at best they will get normal swat to 50% hp, BUT the damage over time effect is now 30 seconds, so keeping your grinder/anarchist regen is even easier. Don't expect to get any kills though. Recommended usage: snipe groups that are far away, so by the time they get to you they have less health.

**Incendiary grenades:** most powerful area denial. Best time to kill. As a con, ammo pick up is almost non-existent.

**Electric nades:** no change.

Also, almost all launchers got reload speed buffs. Especially the piglet.
Launchers that have lower damage then others: Arbiter, Basilisk 3v.
