## Inspired by [IREnFIST](https://modworkshop.net/mod/28585)

### Purpose of this mod:
* Make all weapons equally viable across all difficulties
* Provide new skills to increase build variety
* Decrease reliance on damage increasing skills/OP weapons

##### This mod is not trying to achieve realism by basing weapon stats off of weapon caliber/real life performance. It's not trying to make every weapon deal same DPS as an RPG. The only thing this mod is trying to do, is provide an alternative gameplay experience for any PD2 player, no matter if you are a veteran or a newbie to the game.

-----

##### Description bellow will note __every single change__ made by this mod, including reasons/ideas for most of the changes, whether it's a new skill or weapon damage values.

It's **VERY** long, and that's how it is supposed to be. It's unrealistic for you to remember all the changes and purposes behind them, so having this 'guide' will be useful, if you want to experiment with some new weapon/skill combos. 

Going through all changes might not be a good idea if you are here for the first time, since reading about new weapon stats is not the same as actually playing with them in game (also, i cant fit ALL the stat changes here). So, for first time readers i've created this small guide bellow.

[color=#5ec4d4][size=large]**For players who are here for the first time:**[/color][/size]
||
If you never tried Gilza before, i would recommend learning about it's changes in this order:

1) General changes
2) Melee rework (located almost at the bottom of weapon changes)
3) All Perk and Skill changes (or at the very least those that are marked with a blue [color=#5ec4d4] * [/color] )
4) Weapon changes - general
5) Weapon changes - stability rework and weapon performance
6) Any weapon tabs that you are interested in

After that, make a mental note that this mod __DECREASES__ your overall time to kill with most weapons, but it also __DECREASES__ overall ammo pick up.

After processing all of that, you can probably figure out if you like this rebalance.
And if you do, download it and give it a go.
The 'feel' of how weapons perform in Gilza can not be transcribed directly. It all really comes down to the fact if you like this feel or not, which can only be determined in game.

[FrenchyAU](https://modworkshop.net/user/25971)'s tacticool weapon mod packs are __highly__ recommended to use along side Gilza, to increase your weapon build variety.

However, before installing Gilza don't forget to install other required mods, located under dependencies & instructions tab. Notes:
'AFSF' is not necessary, but some weapons in Gilza had their rate of fire changed, which could lead to full-auto fire sounds mismatching weapon's firing speed.
[More Weapon Stats](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/more_weapon_stats.html) is also recommended if you are a stat nerd, and want to see all weapon stats in game by yourself.
||

-----

Use 'The Fixes' mod to prevent crashes after installing or (most likely) removing this mod.
Additionally, because of the way DMR kits were reworked [color=#ff3333]they might freeze your game[/color], if you try to modify weapons that had DMR kits installed before installing Gilza. Selling those weapons fixes this issue.
Affected weapons: Car-4 AR, Amr16 AR, Ak AR, Ak762 AR, Ks12 AR, Gewehr 3 AR, Broomstick pistol, Akron HC LMG.

-----

:::### General changes:::
||
* All enemies now have same amount of health across all difficulties, with health values of about 130% of health that enemies have on vanilla Death Wish difficulty (Bulldozers on DS still have 2x health)
* All enemies now have a headshot multiplier of 3, except for cloakers, bulldozers (they have 8.5x, should feel close to vanilla PD2) and Winters (his multiplier is 4x)
* Vehicle FOV was changed from base 75 to 90 (you can change it in mod options in game)||

:::Most important/interesting changes are marked with a blue [color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]:::

:::### Perk deck changes:::
||
[color=#ca8f2f] [color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]*Common perk deck cards*:[/color]

**Common 2nd card**: getting a headshot multiplier from perk decks is weird, skill from card#8 was moved here

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk%20card%202.jpg)

**Common 6th card**: now you can pick up normal grenades from ammo boxes without investing into fully loaded skill. This should increase variety in weapon choices. To compensate, grenade amounts were reduced(see throwables tab for more info)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk_card_6%20-%201.8.2.jpg)

**Common 8th card**: random 5% damage increase. Why? Now you receive more movement speed from basic parkour and bag throwing bonus from basic transporter. Those skills were reworked accordingly

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/perk%20card%208.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f] *Perk deck changes:*[/color]

**Sociopath/Infiltrator 1st card**: was changed due to melee rework. Also the hidden infiltrator duration buff was removed, so both decks now have a 4 second window for additional hits

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Overdog_1.7.2.jpg)

[color=#e4df86]**Sicario**:[/color] Smoke bomb cooldown was reduced from 60 to 40 seconds.

**Gambler 1st card**: Gambler overall is a niche deck that can rarely work well, and it's health regen feels really inconsistent, especially if your teammates run builds with berserker and are always on low health. This change should eliminate this issue by giving you more consistent healing, but your max possible burst healing is reduced.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Gambler_1_1.8.1.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Rogue 9th card**: Ever since the introduction of COPYCAT perk deck, rogue became obsolete. If we assume that ricochet and weapon swap+auto reload from copycat are on par with rouge's AP chance and weapon swap speed, it's safe to say that you practically sacrifice 5% overall dodge chance to get health regen and health invulnerability when using copycat instead of rogue. To balance this out, rogue will now gets slightly more dodge, mobility and a more consistent AP chance. If pared with certain skills, this will provide a really fun 'run and gun' experience.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Rogue_9_1.8.2.jpg)
||
:::### New Brawler Perk deck:::
|| 
Sorry, but ModWorkShop's new version forces me to leave a link here, because of the new character limit per mod page:
https://github.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/blob/main/Gilza%20txts/Brawler.md
||

:::### Skill changes:::

__If a certain tree is not mentioned here, that means that it received no changes.__

#### Mastermind
|| 
[color=#ca8f2f]*Sharpshooter sub-tree:*[/color]

**Stable shot**: This skill now only gives accuracy bonuses
(It was meant to be 3 for base and 9 for aced, but game would crash because values are not divisible by 4)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/stable%20shot.jpg)

**Rifleman**: (Renamed to "Agile marksman") Now focuses on using your weapons while moving and aiming. (see weapon's performance tab for more info on new weapon handling)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/rifleman_1.8.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Marksman**: (Renamed to "Slow and steady") buffs LMG's if you use them with bipods, and provides an alternative defensive playstyle for them, considering Gilza's improved bipod accuracy.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/marksman.jpg)

**Aggressive reload**: Slight buff since speed mags exist

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Aggresive_reload_1.8.1.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Graze**: amount of damage that is dealt in the radius is no longer affected by current HP of the target that was hit - now always deals 33%/66% of your sniper's damage in the radius on both bodyshots and headshots. This damage can only be increased with other damage related skills. This change should provide a more consistent experience while using graze, while also reducing it's max effective damage/range.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/graze_1.8.4.jpg)
||

#### Enforcer
|| 
[color=#ca8f2f]*Shotgunner sub-tree:*[/color]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]Shotguns have been reworked significantly, and are now much more effective with no skills. New skills bellow should provide better bonuses considering reworked stats.

**Shotgun CQB**: ADS bonus was moved to shotgun impact

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/shotgunCQB.jpg)

**Shotgun impact**: (Renamed to "Shotgun expert") damage is no longer needed, get some extra stability and ads speed instead

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/shotgun%20impact.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Far away**: (Renamed to "Blast away") magazine increasing skill from Close By aced was reworked into this one, to let any shotgun get benefits from it, but the bonus itself is overall lower.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/far%20away.jpg)

**Close by**: just a slight ROF nerf

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/close%20by.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Overkill**: is not required anymore to use shotguns well, but it will still give you good bonuses if you run it with semi-auto or full auto shotguns with new breakpoints. Also now works even better if aced

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/overkil.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f]*Tank sub-tree:*[/color]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Transporter**: you now get throwing power bonus in perk decks, so it would make sense for this skill to be changed. Aced version is really fun, but requires a hefty investment.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/tranporter.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f]*Ammo Specialist sub-tree:*[/color]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Saw massacre**: now provides ammo pick up for the saw, making it an actually viable weapon. Pick up is not affected by other ammo pick up skills

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Saw_massacre_1.8.1.jpg)

**Fully loaded**: just a buff since now one ever uses this skill. You can now have much more nades throughout the game, but max amount of nades was reduced so you can't spam them all at once as effectively(see throwable changes for more info)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/fullyloaded.jpg)
||
#### Technician
||
[color=#ca8f2f]*Oppressor sub-tree:*[/color]
**Steady grip**: now just a stability skill

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/steady%20grip.jpg)

**Fire control**: aced version now removes Gilza's weapon inaccuracy (more info on that under weapon performance tab)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/fire%20control_1.8.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Body expertise**: this perk is a bit too strong considering increased TTK of Gilza, now gives a bit more fair values, that are still really powerful

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/Gilza_BE.jpg)
||

#### Ghost
||
[color=#ca8f2f]*Artful dodger sub-tree:*[/color]
**Parkour**: movement bonus is now part of perk decks so other upgrades from this skill were moved around

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/parlour.jpg)
||

#### Fugitive
||
[color=#ca8f2f]*Gunslinger sub-tree:*[/color]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Gun nut:** all full-auto pistols got a 25% increase to their normal ROF, while semi-auto pistols got a 50% ROF decrease. This skill was adjusted accordingly. Now semi-auto pistols actually feel different with this skill, while full-auto pistols still have same max total ROF as they did in vanilla. It would feel a bit too pricey to buy extra 20% performance for 4 skill points, so bonuses were swapped and changed slightly

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/gun%20nut%20-%201.7.jpg)

**One handed talent:** (Renamed to "Bottomless pockets") this skill now benefits all pistols in the same way and doesn't depend on damage

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/OHT%20-%20bottomless.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f]*Revenant sub-tree:*[/color]
[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Up you go**: Getting 4% of you total max health for 4 aced points on Mayhem and above is pointless. Now gives you health amounts instead of a %.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/UYG.jpg)

[color=#ca8f2f]*Brawler sub-tree:*[/color]
**Bloodthirst**: Re-balanced according to new melee damage mechanics

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/bloodthirst.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Pumping iron**: (Renamed to "Martial arts") now provides more melee weapon flexibility and quicker charge times to make melee weapons feel better

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/pumpiron.jpg)

[color=#5ec4d4]* [/color]**Berserker**: In theory - cool risk-reward perk. In practice - armorer/anarchist's best friend with barely any downsides. Now provides an active temporary effect triggered on armor break while under half health. This change should provide a more engaging experience while reducing overall effectiveness of this skill. Note that since you are no longer required to be at super low health for this skill to work, you can now run healing skills for decks like anarchist or armorer, to not get one-tapped by snipers. This rework also provides a flash effect on screen to indicate damage increase duration.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/main/Gilza%20pics/berserk_1.8.4.jpg)
This flash can be customized (flash type, color, trigger condition) or disabled in Gilza's mod options. How it looks:

-----

:::### Weapon changes:::

#### General:
||
* All DMR kits were reworked into 'Armor Piercing Kits' that can penetrate body armor, shields and walls. Due to technical limitations, they are now categorized as ammunition
* Most mag increasing mods now make your reload speed slower
* Normal grenades should not explode mid air if hit by bullets (Host only)
||

#### Stability rework and weapon performance:
||

### Weapon performance

[color=#ca8f2f]**All weapon categories:**[/color]
* You now suffer from 25% accuracy penalty when shooting while moving (both ADS and hip-fire)

[color=#ca8f2f]**Changes for weapon categories: AR's, SMG's(+akimbo) and LMG's**[/color]
* You can now suffer from 30% accuracy penalty if your weapon is toggled to full-auto fire mode. If you switch to single-fire fire mode during the heist your accuracy will be increased (provides some usage to the switch fire mod keybind, and also makes you feel tacticool)
* You receive 50% bonus to stability if your weapon is toggled to single-fire mode

-----

### Stability rework

[color=#ca8f2f]**Affected weapon categories: AR's, SMG's(+akimbo),LMG's, Full-auto Pistols(+akimbo), Miniguns(including Hailstorm)**[/color]
* Your base stability value now represents how much recoil your weapon will have by default. This amount can be decreased with weapon modifications as usual
* Amount of horizontal recoil was overall reduced
* Horizontal recoil will now also be dependent on base stability. If base stability value starts with number divisible by 2, recoil will lean mostly to the left, and vise versa. (Example: 24 base stability will favour weapon recoil to the left, and 56 will favour it to the right)

[color=#e4df86]**What does this all mean?**[/color]

Base stability value is now going to be more important then amount of stability bonuses you can give to weapons. If some weapon has base stability of <10 its going to be really hard to control even if you get it to 100 stability with mods/skills. However the opposite is also true, where weapons with high base stability will feel like laser beams, and you won't have to worry about getting any stability bonuses for them. 

Horizontal recoil is overall easier to predict.
You will now have to toggle your weapon's fire mode (if it can do that) based on the engagement distance.

Some weapons might feel the same, and others completely different from vanilla. 
And yes, max recoil you can have here is higher then in vanilla (try Amr-16 with no mods for lolz).
||

[color=#5ec4d4]**All showcases of damage profiles are based on DW difficulty health values.**[/color]
#### Assault rifles:
||
All DMR kits were reworked into Armour piercing kits that can penetrate shields, body armor and walls, but ammo pick up while using them is halved. 
M308 and galant rifles received AP rounds, that are similar to AP kits, but have better ammo economy.
7.62 little friend AR can be equipped with a 5.56 conversion kit that reduces damage but increases ammo pick up
Car-4 AR can use HP rounds to change it's damage profile from 175 to 210

|Damage profile|Headshots to kill normal swat|Headshots to kill heavy swats|Notes|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|105 dmg|2|4|Best for crits|
|146 dmg|2|3|If used with overkill aced, and base damage is increased with mods to 149+ becomes 1-2 bullets to kill type|
|175 dmg|2|3|Basically 146 profile, but with better anti-dozer potential at a cost of total ammo pick up.|
|210 dmg|1|2|Most average, most stable, poor ammo economy if not accurate.|
|420 dmg|1|1|Usually highest recoil and worst ammo economy. Best combined with body expertise/ammo related skills.|
||

#### Shotguns:
||
This one is most interesting in my opinion.
Damage profile depends on shotgun type:

|Shotgun type|Damage profile|Headshots to kill normal swat|Headshots to kill heavy swat|Specialization|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|Pump-action|420 dmg|1|1|Most accurate but slowest. Recommended ammo: slug, to pen shields or HE|
|Semi-auto no mag|305 dmg|1|2|The in-betweeners. Become 1-1 bullets to kill type with overkill. Recommended ammo: flechette or tombstone slugs, to not waste as much ammo finishing off low hp targets|
|Semi or full-auto with mag|110 dmg|2|4|Spammm. Recommended ammo: buckshot for better breakpoints with overkill, HE or Dragon's Breath|
|Double barrel|1250 dmg|1|1|Can one-shot-bodyshot normal and heavy swats. One-shot everyone else in the head. Recommended ammo: flechette or slugs.|

All shotguns now have new damage fall-off. For more detail in game, use "More weapon stats" mod. Short descriptions:
- Double barrel's have best range with 50% damage at furthest point.
- Pump action's have 2nd best range after double barrels, but lowest minimal damage of only 20% at furthest point.
- Semi-auto's are just slightly worse then pump actions and their damage is reduced to 33% at furthest point.
- Full-auto's have shortest range but their drop off is longest in terms of % over range. They still deal lowest damage across all distances, but due to this slow drop off, they are more efficient with crits/body expertise at range since their damage is reduced slower then other shotguns. Minimal damage is 50%.


[color=#ca8f2f]*One new ammo type was added for __primary__ pump-action shotguns:*[/color]

**Breaching round**: Can open any locked space that OVE9000 saw usually can. Allows to pen shields, walls and body armor. Damage and damage fall-off are cut significantly.

[color=#ca8f2f]*All shotgun ammo types were reworked:*[/color]

**Buckshot**: now increases damage based on the shotgun category, so all shotguns gain similar in power breakpoint bonuses. Ammo pick up reduced by 20%

**HE Slug**: doubles your damage (but no headshot extra damage). Removes all stability, cuts ammo pick up by 60% and total capacity by 50%

**Flechette**: no longer gives any stat changes. 'Pellet' amount reduced to 5. Reduces ammo pick up by 10%. Provides body armor piercing and 50% damage range

**AP slugs**: removed accuracy and damage stats, cuts total ammo capacity ~40% and ammo pick up by 25%, provides 20% damage range along with armor piercing

**Dragon's breath**: cuts total ammo by 50%, ammo pick up by 80%. Reduces accuracy and amount of pellets from 12 to 6. No extra headshot damage. Distance at which fire can be triggered was reduced from 1400 to 900. Will deal 1180 damage over a 3 second period to any lit target. (Yes, it one-shots all swat's with any shotgun. Higher damaging shotguns can 'one shot' some specials.)

**Tombstone slug**: cuts total ammo by ~35%, and ammo pick up by 20%. Deals roughly 400 damage over 2 seconds. This will allow for all shotguns to benefit from this slug differently, depending on their breakpoints. Best shotgun shell for regen-based perks.

||

#### Light machine guns:
||
- Breakpoints and TTK are kept the same
- Now use new stability rework = more recoil
- Ammo pick up reduced
- Accuracy without a bipod is extremely poor, but you get extra 50% accuracy when bipoded compared to vanilla

New damage drop off introduced:
80% damage for the first 1.5 meters
100% damage for 14 meters
Progressive increase in damage from 14-36m
150% damage after 36 meters

LMG's will now be better at long range bipoded support, but slightly worse at point blank ranges (note: Akron Hc and Campbell LMG's don't have increased damage at range, and Buzzsaw LMG has 2x damage after 36 meters, instead of 1.5x)

All of the changes above should provide a more defending playstyle, especially if used with new "Slow and Steady" skill.
||

#### Sniper rifles:
||
Damage drop-off removed, now deal same damage regardless of distance.
__All__ snipers were reworked to one-shot headshot any enemy (except dozers and Winters).
Balanced around BODYSHOTS now, and how many bullets it takes to kill enemies in the body.
Damage profile depends on sniper type:

|Sniper type|Damage profile|BODYshots to kill normal|BODYshots to kill heavy swat|Specialization|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|Semi-auto |560 dmg|2 |3 |The basic one, only headshots 1 shot|
|Lever-action |630 dmg|1|2|The anti-trash (enemy type i mean) one. Secondary bolt sniper also uses this dmg profile|
|Bolt action |1260 dmg|1|1 |Kill normal and heavy swats with one shot to the body. Pretty good, ay?|
|Heavy bolt action |1600 dmg|1|1 |Kill normal swat, heavy swat, medics, tazers, and marshal marksmen with one shot to the body. Ammo pick up is lowered by 10%|
|The 50cal|8050 dmg|1|1|Can one-shot-bodyshot anyone. Dozers on DW difficulty take 2 bodyshots to kill, minigun dozers take 4. Double bullet amount for DS difficulty. Ammo pick up is extremely low|

All sniper rifles have __identical ammo pick up.__(except for 50cal and heavy bolt action) Explanation: semi-auto snipers on average are much better when dealing with multiple enemies in a short period of time, thanks to their mag capacity and ROF. Bolt and lever action rifles are worse in this scenario, but due to their bodyshot damage, you don't have to aim for the head all the time, which means your accuracy on average will be higher with them. To summarize: if you are a good shot, semi-auto's will be best weapons of choice, due to their firepower, but if you feel like being lazy, or are not that good of a shot, you can sacrifice DPS to have overall better ammo economy due to less misses.

||

#### All akimbos:
||
Pretty much just copies of their non-akimbo counterparts, with less stability but slightly better ammo pickup. Akimbo SMG's and full auto pistols use new stability rework.
||

#### Specials:
||
Sorry, but ModWorkShop's new version forces me to leave a link here, because of the new character limit per mod page:
https://github.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/blob/main/Gilza%20txts/Special_Weapons.md
||
#### Pistols:
||
__All__ pistols now have no damage drop-off, so they are now more efficient at longer distances then SMG's.
Base ROF for all full-auto pistols was buffed by 25%. (max ROF with gun nut skill totals to be the same as without Gilza)
Base ROF for all semi-auto pistols was nerfed by ~50%
All pistols with AP bullets like 5/7, have reduced ammo pick ups.
Broomstick and Matever .357 revolver can now use AP kit/AP rounds to pen shields, walls and body armor.

With all of the changes above, pistols should now be a really comfortable alternative for mid-long range as a secondary, while SMG's are better up close and snipers at range.

|Damage profile|Headshots to kill normal swat|Headshots to kill heavy swat|Notes|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|77 dmg|3|6|Full auto's|
|95 dmg|3|5|Full auto's|
|105 dmg|2|4|Average|
|146 dmg|2|3|Average, can be combined with overkill skill if damage raised to 149 with mods for improved breakpoints|
|210 dmg|1|2|Heavies like Deagle|
|420 dmg|1|1|Revolvers|
|630 dmg|1|1|Can one-shot-body shot normal swat. Used by Peacemaker and Kahn .357 (with a 6 round mag mod) revolvers|
||

#### Sub machine guns:
||
Kobus90 (better known as P90) can use AP rounds.

New damage fall-off introduced:
120% damage for the first 2 meters
100% damage for 7 meters after
Reduction in damage from 9-35 meters
50% damage after 35 meters

These changes make SMG's a more distinct CQB category. While being extremely effective at closer ranges, they will loose their fire power really quickly at longer distances. If you want to have more firepower at range use pistols or snipers.

|Damage profile|Headshots to kill normal swat|Headshots to kill heavy swat|Notes|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|95 dmg|3|5 |Concealed with high ROF|
|105 dmg|2|4|Average|
|146 dmg|2|3|Can be combined with overkill skill if damage raised to 149 with mods for improved breakpoints|
|210 dmg|1|2 |Heavy|
||

#### Throwables:
||
Most changes here are host-sided. That means that if you are a client you won't benefit from damage or blast radius changes at all.
For the most part, throwable grenades are twice as effective as their launcher counterparts. All other non-grenade throwables are now balanced around bodyshots, and can now pierce body armor of heavy swats. Most throwable weapon amounts were reduced(this change is not host-sided). Additional info and stats are included in throwable weapon's descriptions in game.
||

#### Melee weapon overhaul:

##### Melee weapon damage that you see in your inventory now represent how much % of enemy's HP that weapon will deal with a swing. This includes charged damage as well. So if you have a melee weapon with 25(50) damage, it will kill any[color=#ff3333]* [/color]enemy in 4(2) hits. Additionally grey swats can now be knocked down by melee weapons.

[color=#ff3333]* [/color]Some enemies take less melee damage:
* Bulldozers receive[color=#14a1ad] 3x [/color] less melee damage, so 35dmg melee will kill dozers in 9 hits
* All bosses receive[color=#14a1ad] 5x [/color] less damage, so 35dmg melee will kill bosses in 15 hits
* Winters and his shields receive[color=#14a1ad] 1.5x [/color] less melee damage, so 25dmg melee will kill Winters in 6 hits

Now all melee weapons have certain damage types and fall under one of these categories:
| Type | Damage  | Knockdown |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Weapon butt    | 25     | 100    |
| Weak  | 20(35)     | 20(35)     |
| Average  | 25(50)    | 50(100)    |
| Average - knock   | 25(50)      | 750(1250)    |
| Heavy   | 35(75)     | 70(150)   |
| Heavy - knock   | 35(75)     | 1000(1750)   |
| Super heavy   | 50(100)     | 100(150)    |
| Super heavy - knock   |  50(100)    | 1300(2250)    |

Almost all melee charge sounds were removed, due to charge time mismatch. It's recommended to use some other (HUD) mod to visually show you your melee charge progress.

:::### Custom Weapons Support:::

This mod will automatically search for custom weapons and convert their stats to work with Gilza's changes. Some custom weapons may have attachments that change damage/ammo pick up or other stats in such a way that it will not match Gilza's values. Individual support is required for these mods.

Currently supported attachment mods:
All of [FrenchyAU](https://modworkshop.net/user/25971)'s tacticool attachments packs (250+ attachments)

Weapons that received individual tweaks for all of their stats and attachments (i'll try to add more with each patch):
https://github.com/irbizzelus/random-noncode-stuff/blob/main/Gilza%20txts/Supported%20Custom%20Weapons.md

Custom special weapon support is not planned. Custom minigun support might be added later.

-----

Supported languages (depends on your SuperBLT's language):
- English
- Russian (всё кроме внутри-игровых патчноутов)

Future of this mod:
Damage profiles will most likely never change, but weapon accuracy, stability, ammo pick up, etc. might be changed with future updates.
Also, some melee weapons may need a few more stat tweaks to avoid their animations being too slow/fast.

Enjoy figuring out new META and please provide feedback if something feels way too good. GLHF :D
